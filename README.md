# WePrior DevOps Consulting Website

This is a modern web application built with React and [Convex](https://convex.dev) as its backend.

This project is connected to the Convex deployment named [`loyal-greyhound-628`](https://dashboard.convex.dev/d/loyal-greyhound-628).

## Project structure

The frontend code is in the `src` directory and is built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

The backend code is in the `convex` directory.

`npm run dev` will start the frontend and backend servers.

## App authentication

This app uses [Convex Auth](https://auth.convex.dev/) with Anonymous auth for easy sign in.

## Developing and deploying your app

Check out the [Convex docs](https://docs.convex.dev/) for more information on how to develop with Convex.

- Read the [Best Practices](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices/) guide for tips on how to improve you app further

## HTTP API

User-defined http routes are defined in the `convex/router.ts` file. We split these routes into a separate file from `convex/http.ts` to allow us to prevent the LLM from modifying the authentication routes.
